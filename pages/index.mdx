## The name "Big Magic AI" and why I built this

The name "Big Magic" is from [the book](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Magic-Creative-Living-Beyond/dp/1594634726) by Elizabeth Gilbert. One of the key themes of the book "Big Magic" is the idea that

> creativity is accessible to everyone, not just a select few. Gilbert encourages readers to let go of the fear and self-doubt that often hinder creative expression and to embrace curiosity and playfulness instead. – ChatGPT

The four features I built for this plugin were built to push myself to let go of the fear and self-doubt I have when writing a blog post.

- **Generating content**: assisting in crafting introductions and conclusions with my writing, which are major hurdles for me as a writer
- **Generating images**: currently only supports Dall-E, which isn't my favorite image generator. More models coming soon.
- **Correcting English grammar**: As English is not my native language (I'm from Korea), I'm always conscious of my writing in English. This will help overcome that fear.
- **Translation support in 58 languages**: this feature will be very useful when expanding my blog [codeandfood](https://www.codeandfood.com/) to include Korean, my native language
