### [04/17/2023 ~ 05/17/2023] Battling with PHP

OpenAI API is very easy to use. However, WordPress is built on PHP and creating a WordPress Plugin requires a bit of PHP. It took so much more time than I would've liked, but I'm happy to say that I know a bit of PHP.

### [04/16/2023] Submitted the first s3 week 1 update [nights and weekends s3 by buildspace](<(https://buildspace.so/)>) on [twitter](https://twitter.com/codeandfood/status/1647818819170103297)

Its initial name was 'Write Like Me'. I wanted a plugin that could write a blog post as I would. However, the AI model requires a lot of data to achieve that feature. Therefore, I decided to create features that would make writing blog posts much easier and faster, renaming it as 'Big Magic AI'.
